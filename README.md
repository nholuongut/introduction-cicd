Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) are the Holy Grail for software development teams: no matter who pushes the feature, the same tests are run, the same processes are followed, and nothing gets released without satisfying well-defined quality standards.

Unfortunately, setting up that initial CI/CD workflow can be a bit daunting for teams that donâ€™t have an experienced DevOps engineer.

Fear not, my dear developers! This talk breaks down the basic concepts of continuous integration, continuous delivery, and how to integrate them into your teamâ€™s workflow. Whether youâ€™re working on a small side project or your next big idea, CI and CD can make the journey better.

For this talk, weâ€™ll be using GitLabâ€™s (free) CI/CD pipelines, but the principles translate well to any major CI/CD platform!
